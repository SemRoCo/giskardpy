# giskardpy
The core python library of the Giskard framework for constraint- and optimization-based robot motion control.

## Installation instructions. Tested with Ubuntu 20.04 + Noetic

Do this:
```
sudo pip3 install pybullet
sudo pip3 install scipy
sudo pip3 install casadi
sudo pip3 install sortedcontainers
sudo pip3 install hypothesis
sudo pip3 install pandas
sudo pip3 install numpy
sudo apt install python3-dev 
```
Install one of the following QP solver. The solvers are ordered by how fast they can solve the problem constructed by Giskard. QPOases is the fastest opensource solver for my usecase, that I have found. However, it is still significantly slower than the other two options:
 - Gurobi:
   - ```sudo pip3 install gurobipy```
   - If you have vpn access or are in the local network of the IAI of the University of Bremen, follow these instructions: https://ai.uni-bremen.de/wiki/intern/adm/gurobi
   - Otherwise you can apply for a free academic license or buy a license here: https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/
 - cplex 
   - Check this PR for more information: https://github.com/SemRoCo/giskardpy/pull/77
 - QPOases 
   - Install noetic branch of https://github.com/SemRoCo/qpOASES

Finally, you will need to set the ```qp_solver``` name in the config file, you are loading. E.g. here: https://github.com/SemRoCo/giskardpy/blob/mpc/config/default.yaml.

Now create the workspace
```
source /opt/ros/<ros-version>/setup.bash    # source ROS
mkdir -p ~/giskardpy_ws/src                 # create directory for workspace
cd ~/giskardpy_ws                           # go to workspace directory
catkin init                                 # init workspace, you might have to pip install catkin-tools
cd src                                      # go to source directory of workspace
wstool init                                 # init rosinstall
wstool merge https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SemRoCo/giskardpy/devel/rosinstall/<ros-version>.rosinstall
                                            # update rosinstall file
wstool update                               # pull source repositories
rosdep install --ignore-src --from-paths .  # install dependencies available through apt
cd ..                                       # go to workspace directory
catkin build                                # build packages
source ~/giskardpy_ws/devel/setup.bash      # source new overlay
```

## Fast Custom Bullet Bindings
Giskard will run much faster with Adrian RÃ¶fers bullet bindings instead of the official ones.
```
./scripts/build_pybullet.sh /my/awesome/library/dir

```
If everything worked fine, you should be able to do:
```python
import betterpybullet as bpb
```
Afterwards you can set the collision checker to ```bpb``` in ```config/default.yaml```.
```yaml
collision_avoidance:
  collision_checker: bpb # one of [bpb, pybullet, disable]
```
