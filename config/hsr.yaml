  WiggleCancel: # cancels planning if high frequencies are detected in the trajectory
    amplitude_threshold: 0.15 # the amplitude of a frequency must exceed this threshold to be detected as wiggling
    window_size: 21 # size of the moving window of sample points
    frequency_range: 0.4 # must be in the range [0,1]. Only frequencies in the range [max_detectable_frequency * wiggle_frequency_range, max_detectable_frequency] are considered as wiggling. So a value of 0 means that every frequency with an amplitude above wiggle_detection_threshold is detected as wiggling and a value of 1 means that only the max_detectable_frequency can trigger a wiggle detection.      max_detectable_frequency = 1 / (2 * sample_period)
